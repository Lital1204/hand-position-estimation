# hand-position-estimation

1. HandTrackingMP- performing real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe which provides the XYZ coordinates of the hand's landmarks.
2.mediapipestati- results of the stationary calibration test for the 0,4,20,8 hand landmarks, the coordinates in pixels, time in seconds.
3. handdistance+QR - combining the hand detection code with a QR code detection and distance estimation using OpenCV Python.
