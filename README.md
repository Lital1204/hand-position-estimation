# hand-position-estimation

1. HandTrackingMP- performing real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe which provides the XYZ coordinates of the hand's landmarks.
2. Results of the stationary calibration tests for the 0,4,20,8 hand landmarks
3. handdistance+QR - combining the hand detection code with a QR code detection and distance estimation using OpenCV Python.
